* Right now the biggest problem is that the data is not mutable.
- option 1 is to use RefCell in the data object.

* TODO dim arg for the reductions and activations
softmax needs a dimension where to act as well as mean and sum

* TODO NN testing
- before going into mnist i should see if i can do a complete fw and bw pass
